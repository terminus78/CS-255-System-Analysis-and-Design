# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

> DriverPass wanted a system designed to make the process of learning how to drive easier. An online instruction program, complete with classes, tests, and the ability to schedule driving sessions with an instructor, was to be used to give the prospective driver a strong understanding and practical experience.

**What did you do particularly well?**

> I believe that my business requirements document was especially throrough, given the information I had.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

> If I would have had more time, I would have liked to include more detail in all of my UML diagrams.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

> I put myself in the shoes of the user as well as paid close attention to what DriverPass wanted for their users. It is very important to consider user needs because, ultimately, it is the users that will use the system and fund its continued use. One of the top reasons for failed implementations is failing to consider the user.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

> I approach designing software from a top-down approach. I look at the system as a whole first and what it needs to perform as desired. I then begin an iterative process of defining detail as begin focusing on each use case.
